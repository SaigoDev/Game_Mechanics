# 📌 Unity Game Mechanics Prototype (*Work in progress*)

This Unity project is designed as a **playground for experimenting with mechanics from different games**.  
The goal is to test and implement various gameplay ideas, systems, and interactions in a controlled environment.

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Prototype and test multiple gameplay mechanics
- ✅ Implement mechanics from different genres (e.g., combat, movement, inventory)
- ✅ Modular design for easy testing and iteration
- ✅ Focus on programming logic rather than final visuals

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Unity
- C#

## 📄 Notes

- This project is intended for **learning and experimentation**.
- It demonstrates your ability to:
  - Design reusable systems
  - Implement different gameplay mechanics
  - Debug and iterate game ideas
- No final game is included — this is purely a development environment.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Implement more mechanics from various genres
- Create small playable demos for each mechanic
- Add documentation for each prototype
- Expand with AI, UI, or multiplayer features
